# XMEdit

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jbuyco/xmedit.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jbuyco/xmedit)

A small web app used to create and share an XML document online

## Why?

This was meant to act as a companion to streaming software XSplit (http://www.xsplit.com). Titles can poll remote URLs for XML data. They need to be updated easily and XMEdit was built to do that.
